## 🎯 Project Overview

CreditWise is a complete ML pipeline that takes raw loan application data, processes and engineers features, trains multiple classification models, and serves predictions through a polished interactive web interface.

The system evaluates applicants across 28 engineered features and outputs an approval decision with a probability score, helping understand the key factors driving the result.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **4-page interactive dashboard** built with Streamlit
- **Real-time loan prediction** with approval probability gauge
- **Risk factor analysis** with visual bar indicators per applicant
- **Model performance comparison** — Logistic Regression vs Naive Bayes vs KNN
- **Dataset explorer** with filters and correlation analysis
- **Improvement tips** shown when a loan is rejected

## 🧠 ML Pipeline

### Dataset
- 1,000 loan applications, 19 raw features
- Features: income, credit score, DTI ratio, savings, collateral, loan amount/term, employment, demographics

### Preprocessing
- Missing value imputation (mean for numerical, mode for categorical)
- Label encoding for ordinal features
- One-hot encoding for nominal features
- StandardScaler for feature normalization

### Feature Engineering
- `DTI_Ratio_sq` — squared DTI ratio to capture non-linear risk
- `Credit_Score_sq` — squared credit score for non-linear reward
- `Applicant_Income_log` — log transform to reduce income skew
- Total: **28 engineered features**

### Models Trained

| Model | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | Accuracy |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Logistic Regression** ⭐ | 78.5% | 83.6% | **80.9%** | **88.0%** |
| Naive Bayes | 81.1% | 70.5% | 75.4% | 86.0% |
| KNN (k=5) | 67.3% | 57.4% | 61.9% | 78.5% |

**Best Model: Logistic Regression** — chosen based on F1 Score, which balances both Precision and Recall. In a loan approval system, both false approvals and missed good applicants carry real costs, making F1 the most appropriate metric.

## 📊 Key Insights from EDA

- **Credit Score** is the strongest predictor of approval (correlation: +0.45)
- **DTI Ratio** is the strongest negative predictor (correlation: -0.44)
- **Loan Amount** and **Loan Term** also negatively impact approval chances
- Applicants with credit scores above 700 have significantly higher approval rates
